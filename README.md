MobileNet architecture implemented from scratch. MobileNet architecture is much more efficient than standard convolution neural networks in
terms of parameters and hence the cost. Introducing mobile net blocks slightly decreases the
accuracy as the network has less complexity due to reduced number of weights. Overall, in
terms of accuracy the difference is very minimal, but the network size reduces significantly
